Happy Birthday 2 You  

App Name:  Happy Birtyday App

Happy Birthday 2 You  

Purpose:  

- Learn to create an app with field and form level validation.  

Specification:  

Create an app that allows you to enter a name, a birthday month and day (NOT the birth year).  

Keep a count of how many people entered birthdays and display it in the app.  

Each entry is placed into persistent storage. If 2 dates match, the names are displayed along with the count of entries. Clear the persistent storage to reset the app.  

While the user enters data, validate field data and form level data.  

You must account for fields not being correctly entered as well as the form not being in a valid state.  

For example, Feb 30th is not a valid date, regardless that each field is valid.  

You must allow the user to enter data in any sequence.
