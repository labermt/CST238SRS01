Happy Birthday 2 You

Name: Daniel Lee (Junhyeong)

Notes: I was involved in a car accident last Thursday and haven't had free time until Monday night to catch up on my assignments.
Talked with Mitch so this will be a placholder until I can present Saturday (Possibly Tuesday if needed, but preferred not to delay longer)

Issues: Car Crash


Updated Notes: I found this project to be quite a step up in difficulty from the previous assignment. The basic design layout was not hard, but learning how to correctly output and file io in a different IDE was a challenge. The biggest issue was the form and field validation as I knew what I wanted to achieve, but could not find the best example to learn from.

Updated Issues: Finding good examples of validation for the path I chose to proceed. No one else seemed to do a mix of input and spinner as I did and it felt almost impossible to understand easily how each part needed each other to interact in a proper flowing manner.
