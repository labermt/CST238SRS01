Happy Birthday 2 You

Name: Ruby Felton

Notes: Incomplete

Issues: This went through multiple iteration and was unable to be completed.
    Difficulties using the enviroment and not having enough background to fumble through the languages.
    Ended with a subpar layout and not much connection between java code and xml layout code. No data transactions
    were able to be created and therefore there is no form or field validation. I wanted to have a month dropdown and
    the day drop down would populate dependant on what month was selected (29 days for feb since it is the most days possible
    30 if sept, april, jun or nov selected, 31 for all others)
    text under total people would increment on sumbit button click which would also clear all fields.
    person 1 and person 2 remain as placeholders till a match is found then are replaced with the names entered
    Wanted to include help text "please fill all fields" at top of app on submit if any field is blank it is highlighted in red, entered fields would persist.
