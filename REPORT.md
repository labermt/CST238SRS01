Happy Birthday 2 You

Name: Steven Reeves

Notes: 

Create an app that allows you to enter a name, a birthday month and day (NOT the birth year).

	- Name added via editText
	- Month added via spinner
	- Date added via spinner 

Keep a count of how many people entered birthdays and display it in the app.

	- Count is displayed in bottom left corner
	
Each entry is placed into persistent storage. If 2 dates match, the names are displayed along with the count of entries. Clear the persistent storage to reset the app.

	- Entries placed into shared preference file
	- Entried cleared after match
	- Dialog box for match 

While the user enters data, validate field data and form level data.

	Name field - Anything not empty
	Month field - Any one of the 12 months, not "Select Month"
	Date field - Any one of the dates, not "Select date"

You must account for fields not being correctly entered as well as the form not being in a valid state.

	- Form checked for missing fields.
	- Form checked for invalid dates. 
	

For example, Feb 30th is not a valid date, regardless that each field is valid.

	Dates confirmed invalid - Feb 30, Apr 31, Jun 31, Sep 31, Nov 31 

You must allow the user to enter data in any sequence.

	- Data can be added in fields in any order

Issues:

	- Persistent data 
	- Error messages on Spinners not showing

Would be nice:

	- Make Date button bigger 
	- Error message on spinners
	- Keyboard hangs on entering name 
	- Overall "look"
